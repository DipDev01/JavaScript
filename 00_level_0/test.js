// This is it learned to print on the console
// Next Step to build E-Commerce platform :)


// Let's see how to do them , First there is something called const, let, var. What are these though
// Let's try it

const platformName = "pauchu"
let platformEmail = "pauchu123@gmail.com"
var contact = 9834892930

// From what i have know there seems to be assignment of these variables something like Declaration and Initialization

// In line 10 "const" is the keyword and "platformName" is the variable where we assigned "pauchu" as value
// There seems to be 3 keywords to declare variable for now at least :)

// Let'sprint in console

console.log(platformName) //Output is pauchu
console.log(platformEmail) //Output is pauchu123@gmail.com
console.log(contact)  //Output is 9834892930


//So what can we do more let's dive deeper

// In programming there is some concepts know as data type 
// Seems to be annoying but it has it's own aspect like

// String can hold anytype of data i.e. @,4,a,""  Numbers , alphabets, and special charecters
// integer can hold numbers
// boolean can hold true,false
// char can hold A,B,c,d any charecter

// So how does these things differ and what are the use case of these things?

// Well it may look similar to one another but every data type has it's own meaning and everything was builded on too many concepts
// We will explore them as time passes
