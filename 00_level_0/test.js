console.log("This will be Amazing")

// This is it learned to print on the console
// Next Step to build E-Commerce platform :)


// Let's see how to do them , First there is something called const, let, var. What are these though
// Let's try it

const platformName = "pauchu"
let platformEmail = "pauchu123@gmail.com"
var contact = 9834892930

// // From what i have know there seems to be assignment of these variables something like Declaration and Initialization

// // In line 10 "const" is the keyword and "platformName" is the variable where we assigned "pauchu" as value
// // There seems to be 3 keywords to declare variable for now at least :)

// // Let'sprint in console

console.log(platformName) //Output is pauchu
console.log(platformEmail) //Output is pauchu123@gmail.com
console.log(contact)  //Output is 9834892930


//So what can we do more let's dive deeper

// In programming there is some concepts know as data type 
// Seems to be annoying but it has it's own aspect like

// String can hold anytype of data i.e. @,4,a,""  Numbers , alphabets, and special charecters
// Number can hold 1,2,3,4 etc witht decimal and floats too
// boolean can hold true,false
// undefined is when we print var that has not been initialized
let email;
console.log(email);

let z=undefined = "hello";
console.info(z); //looks like we can initialize undefined


// let x = null = "Hello" //null cannot be intialized
// consolek.log(x)

// lets try something else\


console.log(undefined>null) //false
console.log(null>undefined) //false
console.log(null==undefined) //It seems to be true
console.log(typeof(null)); //object
console.log(typeof(undefined)); // undefined
console.log(+(undefined)); // NaN
console.log(+(null)); // 0

// So it seems that undefined is itself type undefined byt null is object type
// There is something called NaN which means Not a Number 

// null is something that comes aft
// So how does datatype differ and what are the use case of these things?

// Well it may look similar to one another but every data type has it's own meaning and everything was builded on many concepts
// We will explore them as time passes
// I want to dive into projects basics sucks :(
